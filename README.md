# Basic-Python-Computer-Information-Gathering
Basic computer information gathering using Python programming language. The script aims to collect some necessary information of a computer such as Computer's name and User, processor information, system platform, drives and spaces, stored wifi passwords, host and public IP address, mac address etc.. It also collects current running windows services, background processes, installed applications and chrome's bookmarks and history. The script can be modified to be able to expand its use and purpose.

# Note:
To use and run the python file, you must have at least 3.5 to latest python (https://www.python.org) versions and be able to install some required libraries or modules to use. To use some used modules, you have to manually install them by using pip. If you don't, the script will be limited in use.

# Sample Resources:
In the Sample Resources folder, the script generates a folder named User which came from the computer's user name and there, it stores six info files gathered and collected by it. Each files contains a quick information from a certain computer, where you launch the script. To be able to use it in any windows system, you have to compile it in an executable file with the help of PyInstaller (https://www.pyinstaller.org/)..
